# Boulder City Council Tracker - Demo Strategy

## ðŸŽ¯ **Demo Overview**

This document outlines our strategy for demonstrating the Boulder City Council Tracker to potential customers, leveraging both our existing automated system and the newly launched Boulder Reporting Lab vote tracker.

## ðŸ“Š **Competitive Analysis: Our System vs Boulder Reporting Lab**

### **Boulder Reporting Lab's Approach:**
- **Manual Process**: Human-curated spreadsheet from PDF meeting minutes
- **Limited Scope**: Only formal votes and "nods of five" since Dec 7, 2023
- **Static Updates**: Periodic updates as new minutes are released
- **Basic Categorization**: Simple topic tagging (housing, climate, budget)
- **Spreadsheet Output**: Google Sheets format for public access

### **Our System's Advantages:**
- **Automated Intelligence**: AI-powered text parsing and decision extraction
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All meeting types, informal decisions, quotes, and member involvement
- **Real-time Updates**: Automated scraping with GitHub Actions
- **Rich Data Model**: Member profiles, voting patterns, quote tracking, and decision analytics
- **Modern Web Interface**: Searchable, filterable, and interactive dashboard
- **API-First Architecture**: Scalable for multiple cities and integrations

## ðŸš€ **Demo Enhancement Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Data Integration (Immediate)**

- **Source Attribution**: Track data sources (BRL vs automated scraping)
- **Validation**: Cross-reference our automated results with BRL's manual curation

#### **1.2 Enhanced Data Sources**
```python
# Multiple data sources for comprehensive coverage
data_sources = {
    'automated_scraping': 'Real-time from bouldercolorado.gov',
    'brl_vote_tracker': 'Curated from official meeting minutes',
    'manual_verification': 'Human-reviewed for accuracy',
    'historical_data': 'Backfilled from archived records'
