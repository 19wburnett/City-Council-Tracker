# Boulder City Council Tracker - Demo Summary

## 🎯 **Executive Summary**

We have successfully enhanced our Boulder City Council Tracker to leverage the newly launched Boulder Reporting Lab vote tracker as a competitive advantage. Our system now provides a comprehensive demo that showcases automated government transparency versus manual curation methods.

## 📊 **Competitive Analysis: Our System vs Boulder Reporting Lab**

### **Boulder Reporting Lab's Approach (Manual)**
- **Process**: Human-curated spreadsheet from PDF meeting minutes
- **Scope**: Only formal votes and "nods of five" since Dec 7, 2023
- **Updates**: Periodic (weekly/monthly) as new minutes are released
- **Output**: Static Google Sheets format
- **Coverage**: Basic categorization (housing, climate, budget)
- **Scalability**: Boulder-specific, non-scalable

### **Our System's Advantages (Automated)**
- **Process**: AI-powered text parsing and decision extraction
- **Scope**: Comprehensive coverage (all decisions, quotes, member involvement)
- **Updates**: Real-time automated updates via GitHub Actions
- **Output**: Modern web interface + API access
- **Coverage**: Rich metadata, voting patterns, quote tracking
- **Scalability**: Multi-city platform with automated deployment

## 🚀 **What We've Built for the Demo**
